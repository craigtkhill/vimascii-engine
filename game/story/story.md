- **The Crossroads**: Sacred places where multiple paths meet, charged with decision and destiny
- **Artifacts**: Ancient objects of power scattered throughout the land

### Inhabitants

- **Wanderers**: Travelers seeking something (knowledge, treasure, redemption, home)
- **Guardians**: Ancient beings who protect sacred places
- **Spirits**: Manifestations of natural forces and old memories
- **Merchants**: Mysterious traders who appear at opportune moments

## Scene Templates

### Scene Structure
Each scene should follow this general pattern:

1. **ASCII Art** (120×40, bordered with +--|)
   - Depicts the current location/situation
   - Includes labels for key elements
   - Shows character position or relevant NPCs
   - Uses visual metaphors and symbols

2. **Scene Title** (bold, evocative)
   - 2-4 words that capture the essence
   - Examples: "The Crossroads", "Mountain Ascent", "Crystal Cave"

3. **Narrative** (2-4 paragraphs)
   - Paragraph 1: Immediate situation and sensory details
   - Paragraph 2: Context, backstory, or character feelings
   - Paragraph 3: Tension, mystery, or call to action
   - Paragraph 4 (optional): Environmental details or foreshadowing

4. **Choice Prompt** (bold question)
   - "What do you do?"
   - "How do you respond?"
   - "Where do you go?"

5. **Choices** (3-4 options)
   - Mix of: bold action, cautious approach, clever alternative, risky gambit
   - Each choice should feel meaningful
   - Avoid "obvious best choice" - make them interesting trade-offs

### Scene Transition Types

**Exploration**: Moving to a new location
- Describe the journey
- Introduce new environment
- Present new opportunities or dangers

**Encounter**: Meeting an NPC or creature
- Build atmosphere before reveal
- Give character/creature personality
- Create opportunity for interaction

**Challenge**: Obstacle or puzzle
- Clearly present the problem
- Provide environmental clues
- Offer multiple solution approaches

**Discovery**: Finding something important
- Build anticipation
- Reveal gradually
- Tie to larger narrative

**Reflection**: Quiet moment
- Allow character development
- Process recent events
- Foreshadow future challenges

## Style Guide

### Tone
- **Mysterious but not confusing**: Create wonder without losing clarity
- **Evocative but concise**: Rich description without purple prose
- **Empowering**: Make the player feel their choices matter
- **Immersive**: Second-person perspective, present tense

### Voice
- **Narrative Voice**: Neutral omniscient observer, focuses on sensory details and atmosphere
- **NPC Dialogue**: Distinct personalities, appropriate to character (ancient beings speak differently than merchants)
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Let the world reveal its nature through details

### Writing Principles
1. **Show, don't tell**: Use sensory details rather than stating emotions
2. **Active voice**: Keep the narrative moving forward
3. **Specific details**: "weathered stone marker" not "old rock"
4. **Varied sentence structure**: Mix short and long sentences for rhythm
5. **Foreshadowing**: Plant seeds for later revelations
6. **Player agency**: Always frame player as active participant

### ASCII Art Style
- **Functional clarity**: Art should be readable and clear
- **Symbolic elements**: Use symbols to represent concepts (^ for mountains, ~ for water)
- **Labels**: Include text labels for important elements
- **Composition**: Guide eye to important features
- **Atmosphere**: Use density of characters to create mood (sparse = open, dense = cluttered)

### Choice Design
- **Meaningful consequences**: Choices should lead to genuinely different outcomes
- **Character expression**: Let choices reveal or build character
- **No wrong answers**: Make all choices interesting, not one "correct" path
- **Risk/reward balance**: Bold choices = higher stakes, careful choices = safety vs. opportunity cost

## Example Narrative Fragments

### Opening Lines
- "You emerge from the dense underbrush into a small clearing..."
- "The path ahead splits like a forked tongue..."
- "Something in the air changes as you step forward..."
- "A figure materializes from the mist ahead..."

### Transition Lines
- "Your choice echoes through the realm..."
- "The path accepts your decision with a whisper of wind..."
- "As you move forward, the world shifts around you..."
- "Time seems to fold as you..."

### Descriptive Patterns
- Sight: "The mountains catch the last rays of daylight"
- Sound: "The forest whispers in a language older than words"
- Touch: "The air grows thin and cold against your skin"
- Smell: "The scent of pine and ancient stone fills your lungs"
- Emotion: "A presence here makes the hair on your neck rise"

### Choice Phrasing
- Action: "Take the eastern path toward the mountains"
- Interaction: "Approach the cat and ask for guidance"
- Examination: "Investigate the mysterious cave"
- Retreat: "Turn back to the forest before darkness falls"
- Wait: "Sit and rest by the stone"

## Generation Guidelines

When generating a new scene:

1. **Read all previous scenes** to maintain continuity
2. **Honor player's choice** from previous scene
3. **Incorporate player edits** if they added text to the narrative
4. **Advance the story** toward one of the major plot beats
5. **Create consequences** based on previous choices
6. **Maintain consistency** in world rules and character behavior
7. **Build tension** appropriately (escalate or provide relief)
8. **Provide variety** in challenge types (exploration, encounter, puzzle, discovery)
9. **Include spirit guide** when narratively appropriate (recurring character)
10. **End with meaningful choice** that feels consequential

### Things to Avoid
- Contradicting previous scenes
- Making choices for the player in narrative
- Explaining everything (maintain mystery)
- Repetitive scene structures
- Overly similar choices
- Deus ex machina resolutions
- Purple prose or overwrought description
- Breaking the established world rules

## Special Notes

- The spirit guide (often a cat) is a recurring character who should appear regularly but not constantly
- Magic should feel natural and integrated, not flashy or explained
- The realm responds to player choices in subtle ways
- Weather and time of day can reflect narrative mood
- Ancient things should feel weighty and important
- Each location should have a distinct personality
- NPCs remember player's previous choices when encountered again
