**The Crossroads**

You emerge from the dense underbrush into a small clearing where three paths diverge. The forest here feels
alive with an ancient presence. A mysterious gray cat sits perched on a weathered stone marker at the center,
its luminous eyes tracking your every movement.

The western path descends into dark woods where shadows seem to move of their own accord. To the east, you can
see the path climbing toward distant mountains, their peaks catching the last rays of daylight. The southern
path disappears into a bank of low-lying mist.

The cat's tail flicks once, twice, then stills. It seems to be waiting.

**What do you do?**

- [ ] Approach the cat and ask for guidance
- [x] Take the eastern path toward the mountains
- [ ] Enter the dark woods to the west
- [ ] Follow the misty southern path

**Mountain Ascent**

You follow the eastern path as it winds upward through rocky terrain. The air grows thinner and cooler with
each step. Behind you, the mysterious cat from the crossroads pads silently in your wake, maintaining a
respectful distance.

The path ahead narrows dramatically. To your left, a sheer cliff drops away into swirling mist far below. To
your right, you notice the dark mouth of a cave. Ancient torches mounted on either side flicker with an eerie
green flame that cannot be natural fire.

The sun is setting rapidly, and the temperature is dropping. The cat sits and watches, offering no guidance.

**What do you do?**

- [ ] Continue carefully along the narrow mountain path
- [ ] Investigate the mysterious cave
- [ ] Turn back to the forest before darkness falls
- [ ] Wait here and make camp for the night
